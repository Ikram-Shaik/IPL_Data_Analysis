# 🏏 IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 📘 Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on IPL (Indian Premier League) match and delivery-level datasets. The aim is to derive key insights about team performances, player contributions, match outcomes, scoring patterns, and more through extensive data wrangling and visual exploration.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this project include:

- Understanding the scoring behavior across overs and innings.
- Analyzing team dependency on boundaries for scoring.
- Comparing bowling performances across teams and seasons.
- Investigating dismissal patterns and player matchups.
- Visualizing trends in win/loss records, run rates, and seasonal evolutions.
- Gaining insights into game strategies using analytical reasoning.

## 🧠 Questions Solved

The following analytical questions were addressed:

1. 📊 How are total runs distributed per over across all matches?
2. 💥 How frequently do different teams hit **fours** and **sixes**?
3. ⚠️ Is there a difference in the types of **extra runs** conceded by various bowling teams?
4. ⏱️ How do **run rates** vary across the **powerplay**, **middle overs**, and **death overs**?
5. 🚨 How do **scoring patterns** and **run rates** differ in **super overs** vs. regular overs?
6. 🧹 What is the distribution of **dismissal types** (caught, bowled, LBW, etc.)?
7. 🎯 Which bowlers excel in **wickets**, **economy rate**, and **strike rate**? What are their preferred dismissal methods?
8. 📈 Analyze **win-loss trends** of teams across different **seasons**.
9. 🧤 Which **fielders** contribute most via **catches** and **run-outs**?
10. 🎯 How are **wickets distributed** across different overs?
11. 🔥 Analyze **team bowling strength** using multiple performance metrics.
12. 🤝 What defines a **successful batting partnership**?
13. 🆚 How do **batsmen perform against specific bowlers**? Any notable matchups?
14. 🪓 Do some batsmen get out in specific ways more frequently?
15. ⚡ How does the presence of specific batsmen affect **run rate**?
16. 🕰️ How have **scoring patterns evolved** over seasons?
17. ⚰️ Has the distribution of **dismissal types** changed over time?
18. 📍 How do **runs and wickets** vary across different **venues**?
19. 🌓 Is there a performance difference between the **first and second innings**?
20. 🏆 How has the **average win margin (by runs)** changed over seasons?
